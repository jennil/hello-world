Sample repository to get started with GitHub

I'm joining GitHub at the recommendation of my software engineering nephew.  He says it is something a lot of prospective employers are looking for.  So, here I am, signing up, because. . .  I am about to graduate, at last!  Headed into my final semester.  SO EXCITED to get out there into the "real world" of programming!
